<p>SpinMeRound was written as the final project for a student-taught Intro to IDL class at Berkeley. Although newer releases of IDL include sophisticated 3D data visualization abilities (I'm told), the release that is widely available through the Astrophysics department was at the time some 2+ releases behind the times. As such, visualization options were sorely lacking, and to that end I present a quick and dirty viewer for 3D point data, including auto- and manual rotation capabilities. In essence, SMR is simply an iterated <code>oplot</code> command, with added depth shading.</p>

<a name="laziness" class="anchor" href="#laziness"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Laziness</h3>

<p>I have very little practical use for this program myself, as if I really wanted to plot 3D data, I would stick it into Mathematica. As such, don't expect major updates. If you get one, it means that I'm <em>really</em> bored. I admit that it really should have a zoom function, however, so it's likely that I'll add that at some point.</p>

<p>Feel free to take, modify, fork, spoon, and otherwise traumatize this code. If it fills a hole in your heart, oh up-to-date-IDL-distribution-denied citizens of the world, I'm happy for you. Except not, because of the 'being denied' bit.</p>

<p>Chris Wieland (<a href="https://github.com/PetrichorAndSmoke" class="user-mention">@PetrichorAndSmoke</a>) is a triple-major at UC Berkeley. He also may or may not be Legolas in disguise.</p>

<p>If you've come to this page researching Chris Wieland before hiring him, <strong>NOTE that</strong> he is not actually lazy, he just claims that he is to avoid updating programs for obsolete distributions of IDL. He only occasionally talks about himself in third person.</p>
